This repo. contains spider induction processes tasks which are devided as domain (Web dev) and common task(UI/UX, Web dev, Devops).

$For the Domain Specific task, 
I made a eye-catching Dics Strike 4 Game. Its a Two player Game with Blue and Red taking turns one after another. Opponent can block any one column of his choice and the other can't place their disc in that column. This happens in every turn, till four dics are placed together either Horizontally, Vertically, or Diagonally. Their is Game Timer and PLayer Timer aswell, so watch is carefully!!
